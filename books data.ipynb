(The classics Hombre, Valdez is Coming, and 3:10 to Yuma were just a few of his notable works.) With his extraordinary Cuba Libre, Leonard ingeniously combines all of his many talents and delivers a historical adventure/caper/western/noir like none other. The creator of U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, star of Raylan, Pronto, Riding the Rap, and TV\\u2019s Justified, spins a gloriously exciting yarn about an American horse wrangler who escapes a date with a Cuban firing squad to join forces with a powerful sugar baron\\u2019s lady looking to make waves and score big in and around Spanish-American War-torn Havana in 1898. Everything you love about Leonard\\u2019s fiction\\u2014and more\\u2014is evident in Cuba Libre.
